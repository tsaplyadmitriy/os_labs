Physical address - adress of a real data slot in hardware (physical) memory 

Virtual address  -  pointer to a memory space that an OS gives to a process to work with.

Virtual memory amound is usually larger than physical memory. Sometimes VA and PA are different, so VA is mapped to the PAs dynamically in RAM.
