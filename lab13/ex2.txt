Recovery: this method is convenient if it is ok to either kill the process or preempt it's resources, although it cannot be used neither in real-time systems or batch systems.

Prevention is the best strategy if we know requests from processes in advance and also that these requests won't change. Then, the problem of planning is decidable. 

Avoiding is good when we receive new requests of resources and we want to dynamically make such decisions that won't lead to deadlocks: for this, banker's algorithm is used. This approach is good for interactive systems.
